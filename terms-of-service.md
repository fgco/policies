# Terms of Service

*Last updated: December 11, 2020. [commit](https://github.com/fgco/policies/commit/main)*

> Adapted from the [Basecamp open-source policies](https://github.com/basecamp/policies) / [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Thank you for using our products! Because we don't know every one of our
customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help
keep the ship afloat.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring
to Final Gravity AB.

When we say "Services", we mean any product created and maintained by Final
Gravity AB. At the moment that includes only Cupaloy, whether delivered within
a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations
that own an account with one or more of our Services. Cupaloy accounts are
owned by individuals, not by organizations. When you sign up and create
a Cupaloy account, you are the owner of that account and all the data in it.
Our legal responsibility is to the account owner, so we won’t let other people
take over your account without your permission.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes
made since late-2020 [on
GitHub](https://github.com/fgco/policies/commits/main).

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest
Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and
all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we
do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in
doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. **These terms do contain
a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad
statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best
to deserve that trust by being open and keeping an open door to [your
feedback](https://cupaloy.com/feedback).

## Account Terms  

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. This also
   includes your email account at a third party since we send authentication
   links to your email address. The Company cannot and will not be liable for
   any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security
   obligation. We recommend users set up strong passwords and two-factor
   authentication for their email accounts for added security. 
2. You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our [Use
   Restrictions policy](#use-restrictions).
3. You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under
   your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have
   access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your
   account.
4. You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated
   methods are not permitted.

## Payment

1. If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free:
   we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay
   for our Services — we do not sell your data.
2. For paid Services you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. This
   is true for subscriptions as well as one time payments.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Within each
   of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link.
   An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically
   considered cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can
   always [contact our Support team](mailto:help@finalgravity.co).
2. All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services immediately upon
   cancellation. All content will be permanently deleted from active systems.
   Within 60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We
   cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.
3. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and
   all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time.
   Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to
   access the account or any content in the account. Termination will
   furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your
   account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your
   account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to
   anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically
   speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services,
   there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we
   staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For
   more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy](#use-restrictions).
5. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or
   retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in immediate account
   termination.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we
   redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we
   decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time
   to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our
   Services with or without notice.
2. Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that,
   we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may
   choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will
   give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on
   record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the
   affected Services themselves.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on
   an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level
   agreements for our Services.
2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage
   significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services.
   Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action
   except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the
   performance of the Service for other customers.
3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups,
   redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission
   from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your
   data through our network unencrypted. When you use our Services, you entrust
   us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that we may
   process your data as described in our [Privacy
   Policy](https://cupaloy.com/privacy-policy/) and for no other purpose. We as
   humans can access your data for the following reasons:

   - **To help you with support requests you make.** We'll ask for express
     consent before accessing your account.

   - **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated
     process partway through.** We get automated alerts when such errors occur.
     When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking
     at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum
     amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to
     fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from
     reoccurring.

   - **To safeguard our Services.** We'll look at logs and metadata as part of
     our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole.
     If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report
     investigation.

5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary
   hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to
   run the Services.
6. We process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for
   and as described in these Terms of Service, [Privacy
   policy](https://cupaloy.com/privacy-policy/). We do not retain, use,
   disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes
   unless we have your explicit permission.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. All content posted on the Services must comply with european copyright law.
2. We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to
   the Services. All materials uploaded remain yours.
3. We do not pre-screen content, but reserve the right (but not the obligation)
   in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via
   the Service.
4. The names, look, and feel of the Services are copyright© to the Company. All
   rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the
   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without express written
   permission from the Company. You must request permission to use the
   Company's logo or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please [email
   us](mailto:help@finalgravity.co) requests to use logos. We reserve the right to
   rescind this permission if you violate these Terms of Service.
5. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any
   portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services
   without the express written permission by the Company.
6. You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is
   associated with the Services or the Company.

## Use Restrictions

We recognize that technology is an amplifier: it can enable the helpful and the
harmful. That’s why we’ve established this policy. If you have an account with
any of our products, you can’t use them for any of the restricted purposes
listed below. If we find out you are, we will take action.

## Restricted purposes

* **Child exploitation, sexualization, or abuse**: We don’t tolerate any
  activities that create, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse. Keep
  away and stop. Just stop.

* **Doxing**: If you are using our products to share other peoples’ private
  personal information for the purposes of harassment, we don’t want anything
  to do with you.

* **Infringing on intellectual property**: You can’t use our products to make
  or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others.

* **Malware or spyware**: Code for good, not evil. If you are using our
  products to make or distribute anything that qualifies as malware or spyware
  — including remote user surveillance — begone.

* **Phishing or otherwise attempting fraud**: It is not okay to lie about who
  you are or who you affiliate with to steal from, extort, or otherwise harm
  others.

* **Spamming**: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t tolerate
  folks (including their bots) using our products for spamming purposes. If
  your emails don’t pass muster with
  [CAN-SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)
  or any other anti-spam law, it’s not allowed.

* **Cybersquatting**: We don’t like username extortionists. If you purchase an
  account in someone else’s name and then try to sell that account to them, you
  are [cybersquatting](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125).
  Cybersquatting accounts are subject to immediate cancelation.

* **Violence, or threats thereof**: If an activity qualifies as violent crime
  in the EU or where you live, you may not use our products to plan,
  perpetrate, or threaten that activity.

We’ve outlined these restrictions to be clear about what we won’t stand for.
That said, this list is by no means exhaustive. We will make changes over time.

## How to report abuse

See someone using one of our products for one of the restricted purposes? Let
us know by emailing [help@finalgravity.co](mailto:help@finalgravity.co) and we
will investigate. If you’re not 100% sure, report it anyway.

Please share as much as you are comfortable with about the account, the content
or behavior you are reporting, and how you found it. Sending us a URL or
screenshots is super helpful. If you need a secure file transfer, let us know
and we will send you a link. We will not disclose your identity to anyone
associated with the reported account.

Someone on our team will respond within one business day to let you know we’ve
begun investigating. We will also let you know the outcome of our investigation
(unless you ask us not to or we are not allowed to under law).

**This policy and process applies to any product created and owned by Final
Gravity AB.**

## Features and Bugs

We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is
no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that
our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any
software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to
us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or
privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely
error-free Services.

## Fair Use

When we grant you unlimited features, for example unlimited storage, we mean
that we do not limit the feature in any technical way. That does not mean that
there are no limits at all. There are, amongst others, physical limits set by
third party service providers to us.

You agree to use our Services in a fair way. Where the exact limits of fair use
are will be considered at the time of usage. We mean by that, that 20 years ago
1 GB of data was a lot. Today, it is not anymore. We do not want to tie
ourselves to the current time with our products. 

We reserve the right in the future, in our sole discretion, to set reasonable
limits on all accounts where we consider a case of violation of fair use has
occurred. 

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in
law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect,
incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary
damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill,
use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of
the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability
to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and
services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or
obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the
Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or
data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any
other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as
a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or
any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on
us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to
be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business;
investments in security, infrastructure, and talent. If you choose to use our
Services, thank you for betting on us. 

If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please [contact our
Support team](mailto:help@finalgravity.co).
